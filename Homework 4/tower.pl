% N is a nonnegative integer specifying the size of the square grid
% T, a list of N lists, represents each row of the square grid
% each row is a list of N distinct integers from 1 to N (same with columns)
% C is a structure with function symbol counts and arity 4
% C's arguments are lists of N integers, representing the
% tower counts for top, bottom, left, right respectively

tower(N,T,C) :-
    C = counts(Top,Bottom,Left,Right),
    length(T,N) % T must contain N lists
